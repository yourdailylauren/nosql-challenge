# nosql-challenge
This code was written after following examples provided for in class. The troubleshooting came from reading any error codes and then adjusting the code until the correct output was provided.

One issue came up in that the file NoSQL_analysis_starter requires us to search for rated 5 star restauarants within 0.01 degree along with the originally added Penang Flavours restaurant. The Penang Flavors restaurant was listed at:

latitude = 51.49014200 <br>
longitude = 0.08384000

When writing this code, 0 results came up that followed the search criteria. I can only assume, following writing more code to expand my search and show other results, that the 0 results in the assignment are by design.
